Question 7

After data matching, a report must be generated, which has to be accessible from anywhere in the
laboratory. Also, data needs to be moved to a long term storage. Based on this

(a) How do you deliver your reports?
    1) Create a secure database for reports that can be queried based on patient sample or dates 
    2) Develop a standardize template for reports, including results, QC metrics, etc.  

(b) How do you know if the analysis passed QA/QC and then can be moved to the storage?
    - For analysis QA/QC passed, write script to determine if analysis passes QC mertics. 
        If analyisis passes, create a flag in sample analysis directory "QC.PASSED".
        If script returns a failure, create flag in sample analysis direectory "QC.FAILED"

(c) Long term storage is in another network hub (not in the lab intranet) which is also protected by
the same firewall. What would be your preferred method to transfer data? Would be manual or
automated transfer?
     - I would create a program that can manually be run to move a analysis directory into long term storage
     It would take the directory path that neeeds to be filled and would ensure that the QC.PASSED flag is
     present in the directory before moving to long term storage.
