Question 6

NGS and PCR data need to be matched properly and one result will validate the other and vice-versa.
Considering this, how do you

(a) avoid matching errors?
- Match only on sample IDs rather batch times/files
- Timestamp files to ensure cooresponding times make sense with the files 

(b) provide feedback to the user regarding successful and unsuccessful matches?

- Files will not be moved to sample directories unless the ID matches
- LOG ERROR for files will be displayed when a directory does not exist for ID based on the NGS data 
- Create a file log of all sample files that are created in each batch to reference for directory creation
