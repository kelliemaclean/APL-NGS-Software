# Validating Variant Analysis

1) Visualizing the variant calling results
2) Use multiple tools to compare results
3) Utilize databases like dbSNP to determine likelihood of vairants
4) Use multiple QC metrics
5) Filter variants based on QD score, Haplotype Score, FS scores, Depth
6) Allele count vectors/allele balance 
7) Mapping quality scores
