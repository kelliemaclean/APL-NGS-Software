Question 8
One day, the clinically validated PCR machine breaks and now the data will be generated in another
room in the same lab.
(a) Do you need to re-validate your software?
    Yes. 
(b) If so, what would be best approach?
    Have baseline testing data that can be re-run though entire workflow to see if the same results
    are generated with new machine. 
(c) You need to transfer your software to the new desktop machine, or not?
    No, the software should be kept in a directory accessible to any machine connected to the network. 
    Software should be run from a maintained software location.
