Question 4:
PCR runs aremonthly, while NGS are weekly. PCR results provide ancillary data that will be compared
to some variants obtained from sequencing, and the machine generates a simple CSV/TSV file with
one column containing the sample ID and 10 more result columns. Thereâ€™s no way to automate data
extraction from the PCR machine, and the data needs to be generated by a technologist on a desktop
computer (connected to the network) and then transferred to another location.

a) What do you suggest would be the best way to transfer the data from one point to another?

- The best way to transfer the data files from one location to another would be by using a scheduled
python script with a cron job to move the CVS/TSV from a directory within the network to the new desired location. 

python script:
'''
def get_pcr_csv():
    my_file = []
    os.chdir("/aplnetwork/pcrresults")
    files = glob.glob('*.csv')
    for file in files:
        my_file.append(file)
    return my_file

def move_pcr_file():
    all_file=get_pcr_csv()
    for file in all_file:
        shutil.move("/aplnetwork/pcrresults/"+file, "/aplnetwork/newdir/"+file)
'''

b) What do you suggest to minimize problems from the data being exported by the machine?

1) Automate the job so it repeats the same process everytime
2) timestamp the files to prevent files from being over written
3) include sample ID in the file name and create new directory for each ID
i.e., /aplnetwork/newdir/sampleID
